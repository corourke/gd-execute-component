This is a trivial create-react-app to test the GD Execute component.

I'm still trying to understand how it should be used in a React application.

___

After starting the app, you must first navigate to:

```https://localhost:3000/account.html```

To log into the GoodData workspace.

1. The transformation attribute to the Execute component seems to do nothing
2. Not sure how to pass the onLoadingChanged and onError state to the componenent
3. Not sure if there is a way to get the metric name from the query
4. Not sure how to pass the results of the Execute to multiple visual components
